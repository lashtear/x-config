This is a collection of random configs I'm using for my X11 setup on Chrysalis.  I don't expect this to be directly useful for anyone other than me, but sometimes people ask, so here it is!

See https://github.com/lashtear/coindesk-bpi for the bitcoin/coindesk-bpi tool in the bottom bar.

Remember, the layout and naming is a bit odd as this is more or less a direct copy of my `~/.xmonad` directory.  See https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad/ for more information about that fine window manager.
